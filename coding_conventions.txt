Coding Conventions

The goal of this document is to define the stable consistant sdk interface.

FILENAMING: Files are named in CamelCase starting with a capital letter.
    
NAMESPACES: Namespaces shall be named using all lower case and snake case if it is multiple words.

CLASS/TYPE NAMING: Classes shall be named in CamelCase starting with a capital letter.  

FUNCTION NAMING: Classes shall be named in camelCase starting with a lower case letter.  

VARIABLE NAMING: Variable shall be named with camelCase starting with a lower case letter. If the varible contains an acronym then only capitalize the first letter in the acronym. Prefer full words to abbreviations.  
Examples:
    I32 helloWorld;
    float showGuiScale;
    I64 mipsPerSecond;
    I64 windowsSdkVersion;
    

CONSTANT NAMING: Constants and enums values should be in upper case SNAKE_CASE. Enum type names should be named as a type in CamelCase. 
Examples:
    const I32 WARP_FACTOR=10;
    enum CapacitorType {
        FLUX_CAPACITOR, 
        DECOUPLING_CAPACITOR
    };

SCOPES: Always use curly braces on your statements, especially single line if statements. This includes all code blocks: if, for, while, switch, etc.
Examples:  
    if(that) { return other; }
    if(that)
    { 
        return other; 
    }
    while(that) 
    { 
        doOther(); 
    }
